# Happy Thoughts
Requirements for this weeks work:

Your page should follow the design as closely as possible
Your app should be responsive (it should look good on devices from 320px width up to at least 1600px)
Your app should have a text area and a submit button. When the button is clicked, your app should empty the form and show the form submission in a message card according to the design.
Your code should follow the guidelines on how to write clean code

During this week and project I learned to understand the basics of React.
I practiced how to use the useState hook, managing state for: the input field, the list of thoughts,updating likes.

The app includes:

a header

a form for writing a message

a list of message cards
